## Brain — Development Workflow

This project uses **Brain**, an agentic AI-first development workflow manager. All development state lives in `./_brain/`. Work is organized into **milestones** composed of sequential **stages**. Each stage is a spec file with tasks and acceptance criteria that must be fully met before moving on. For more process information and file formats see `_brain/help.md`
